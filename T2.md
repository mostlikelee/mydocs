TouchID
-------
T2 Chip is responsible for securing TouchID

Encryption
----------
SSDs are now fully encrypted via the T2 Chip out of the box.

If the T2 chip and SSD are separated, or if the portion of the 
T2 chip containing encryption keys becomes damaged, decryption is
not possible.

Enabling FileVault is still a best practice to require a password
to decrypt your drive.

Secure Boot
-----------
Disables external media boot (macOS install exception)
